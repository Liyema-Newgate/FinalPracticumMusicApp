My Practicum Music Viewer App
The app we were tasked to build asks us to save data about 4 songs, their ratings, song comments, and the artists. 
It also stipulates we save user input then have a second screen to view said information as well aas an exit button. 
You will find i have achieved this in my code using parallel arrays and loops.
